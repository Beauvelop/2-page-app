## Ambitions for this project:

+ A new styled approach to the (United States) drop-down.
+ No CSS file. As a proof of concept, I want to do a first website without a css file.
  This would challenge me to exploit the nature of StyledComponents and theming.
*This does come at a cost of the CSS being parsed twice both by css parser and by the javascript*
+ Executing audio with the signup page as a short UX response to valid & invalid inputs by the user.

## Further improvements to be made
+ scrnshot to cover the gifs to simulate playbuttons
+ landscape breakpoints for iphones. --> Now, they look pretty awful.
+ reworking of the color palette and typography.
+ uglification
+ normalize
+ prep data inputs for back-end storage.
+ HOSTING!


## Last day TODOS

+ WCGW at footer on mobile
+ port signup to retro signup
+ consider buttons with labels for states that appear upon region click
+ replace acronyms with full names of regions in "monitor"
+ folder tree for each region
+ comment code for component nodes. Be short and to the point.
+ glitch animation on monitor? --Only if there's time...



## CLI commands
